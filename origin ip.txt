HOW TO FIND :

1. dig +short example.com
curl -s https://ipinfo.io/IP | jq -r '.org'

2.Use https://dnsdumpster.com to generate a map.

3.Next, make a search using Censys and save the IP's that look to match your target in a text file. Example: https://censys.io/ipv4?q=......

4. Another way you can find IP's tied to a domain is by viewing their historical IPs. You can do this with SecurityTrails DNS trails. https://securitytrails.com/domain/example.com/dns

5.If you enumerate your targets DNS, you may find that they have something resembling a dev.example.com or staging.example.com subdomain, and it may be pointing to the source host with no WAF. 

- Get all the subdomains.
    `subfinder -silent -d 0x00sec.org | dnsprobe -silent | awk  '{ print $2 }'  | sort -u | tee -a ips.txt`

6. for ip in $(cat ips.txt) # iterate through each line in file
do 
    org=$(curl -s <https://ipinfo.io/$ip> | jq -r '.org') #  Get Org from IPInfo
  title=$(timeout 2 curl -s -k -H "Host: example.com" <https://$ip/> | pup 'title text{}') # Get title
    echo "IP: $ip Title: $title Org: $org" # Print results

7. censys cmd:
censys search hackerone.com | grep “ip” | egrep -v “description” | cut -d “:” -f2 | tr -d \”\,

8. shodan :
shodan search Ssl.cert.subject.CN:”hackerone.com” 200 — fields ip_str | httpx
